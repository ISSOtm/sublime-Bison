Sublime-Bison 2.0.0 changelog:

Fully rewrote syntax, using better techniques:

 - Rewritten reading through the Bison docs, should be more accurate

 - Syntax should be more lenient and recover from syntax errors better

 - Rules will now show up in "Goto anything"

 - Autocomplete is now aware of possible symbols in declarations; some of them are scattered in the docs, so let me know if I missed any

 - Like the above, but with variable names as well

Given the size of the changes, please let me know ("Issues" link on https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Bison) if this update broke your workflow somehow, or if there are glaring syntax errors.

Known problems:

 - The syntax is only designed to embed C code, which should be fine for C++ code, at least for the most part. Feedback is appreciated.

 - Named refs don't work, for some reason
